processConversation: >
  ### Instructions:
  You have two tasks to perform based on the provided conversation and personal details. Follow each task step-by-step and ensure that the output is well-structured and distinct for each part.

  1. **SUMMARY**: Provide a concise summary of the given conversation. Limit your response to 40 tokens or fewer. Use the text provided in "combinedText". Ensure the summary captures the main points and purpose of the conversation.

  2. **PERSONAL DETAILS**:
   You will receive a message containing personal details and meaningful life events. Your task is to extract this information and create a well-structured Markdown file containing personal details, significant life events, and any other attributes provided.

   **Instructions**:

   **Personal Details Section**:
   - Extract the following standard attributes: firstName, lastName, age, maritalStatus, and location.
   - For any missing attributes, use default values ("Unknown" for strings and 0 for numeric values).
   - Format this section with the main headline "# Personal Details" and list each attribute under this section.
   - Attributes are marked as **Attribute Name**: Value.
   - Each attribute must have only one line
   - Try infer the misssing attributes data from the conversation text and existing personal details for exmpale if my wife died today than i am widowed.
   - dont add atrributes that are not in the list

   **Significant Life Events Section**:
   - Identify and extract any mentions of significant life events, personal milestones, or experiences (e.g., career changes, loss of a loved one, major accomplishments, etc.).
   - Format this section under a new headline "## [the type of the event]".
   - In case the user gave new details about an event, update the event description.
   - List each life event as a bullet point or in a brief descriptive paragraph format.
   - ensure that each event is accompanied by a timestamp formatted as [Year, Month, Day] or [Year, Month], based on the precision available for the event. Ensure these timestamps are absolute and globally recognized, avoiding any relative descriptions like "yesterday" or "last month."
   - Convert all relative dates in the text (e.g., "yesterday," "next month") to absolute, globally recognized timestamps. Use the format [Year, Month, Day] for specific dates or [Year, Month] when only the month and year are known. Avoid any relative terms.
   - Only categorize to the given options.
   - dont add events that happend between the bot and the user.


   **Combining Data**:
   - Incorporate any existing personal details from previous files into the new Markdown structure, ensuring all data is appropriately formatted.
   - Do not keep the original JSON format—convert all relevant data into plain text as per the guidelines.
   - Ensure the output is clean, well-structured, and easy to read.

   **Output**:
   Return the entire result as a Markdown-formatted text. Ensure that it contains clear sections for each attribute and event, and that all data is captured correctly without omission.

  ### Input:
  1. **Conversation Text**: "{{combinedText}}"
  2. **Personal Details and Events**: "{{personalDetails}}"
  3. **Todays Date**: "{{date}}"

  ### Output:
  Provide the outputs for both tasks separately as Markdown-formatted text. Ensure each task is clearly separated and labeled with only its task description as the key, followed by the response. This format should be easy to parse into a map; do not add anything to the keys! Keep a one-line space between the keys and the response.use ### to mark tasks.
